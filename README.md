### Next.js application for reading and editing workout spreadsheet

Jeff Nippard's workout plans are great but the spreadsheet the plan comes in isn't great for use in the gym. 

So I create this application as a user interface overlay to make working out to the program a more pleasurable experience. Simply upload your Nippard workout sheet to your Google Drive. The program is agnostic to what sheet you provide so feel to use your own workout program as well.
